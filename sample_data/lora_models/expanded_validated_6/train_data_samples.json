Players unstack the pieces by moving pieces off of the stack, but remaining on the same point, according to the throws of the dice. The value of the throw indicates the number of the point which can be unstacked. For example, a throw of 1 and 4 allows the player to unstack the pieces on points 1 and 4. Doubles allow players to only move one piece, but grant the player another throw. When all of a player's pieces are unstacked, they must be restacked, in the same way. When they have been successfully restacked, the player then bears off the pieces from this quadrant of the board.

Including this fifth square, a square track with eleven squares per side, with a marked square in each corner and middle square of each side. Five pieces per player. Seven cowries used as dice. The number of mouths up equals the value of the throw; when no mouths are up the player loses their turn. Players begin from opposite ends of the bottom track, and proceed up the vertical track, around the square, and then up the remainder of the vertical track. A player must throw a 1, 5, or 7 to enter the board. Throws of 1, 5, or 7 grant the player another throw. If a piece lands on a space occupied by a piece belonging to the opponent, the opponent's piece is removed from the board and must enter again. Pieces resting on a marked square are safe from being sent back. The player who moves all five of their pieces beyond the final space in the vertical row with an exact throw wins."

Each player rolls one die. The player who rolls highest goes first. The player then rolls two die to begin play.

A player must use both numbers of a roll if possible, or all four numbers in the case of doubles. If a player lands on a point occupied by a single opposing piece, the opponent\u2019s piece is trapped until the trapping player removes their piece.

A player bears off by rolling a number equal to the number of points left in the track of a piece, plus one.
